### Song Exporting


You'll want your song folder to look like this

```plaintext
mods/
└── images/
    └── songs/
        └── songNameGoesHere/
            ├── Inst.ogg
            ├── Voices-Opponent.ogg
            └── Voices-Player.ogg
```

This allows for split vocals with the opponent and player character vocals separate.

If you want to have your voices together or you're porting a mod that has the voices together, then use this:

```plaintext
mods/
└── images/
    └── songs/
        └── songNameGoesHere/
            ├── Inst.ogg
            └── Voices.ogg
```

The combined vocal track will be listed as the main/player voice track in chart editor
